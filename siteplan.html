        Colorado River after having experienced a walk along the Bright Angel
        Trail from the southern edge of the Grand Canyon, to refresh ourselves
        we take our Rafting equipment, although we do not have an itinerary, our
        adventures Daily events Can include Elves Chasm Fern Grottoes, Deer
        Creek Falls, a 100-foot drop, the limestone slides of Matkatamiba
        Canyon, and the teal pools of Havasu Canyon. Along the way, we are
        amazed at the majestic hues and rock formations that surround us as we
        float through the legendary landscape of the Grand Canyon National Park,
        allowing our participants to take all kinds of photographs, and finally
        we offer them to spend the Night Camp in the area of the rift from the
        hurricane destroyed before heading to Diamond Creek to get our take out.

        The Site Map of a site is just like it sounds…it is a map of the pages
        in a site and how they are related and linked together. From the map
        above we can see that we will eventually have the Home page and 2 sub or
        child pages.
      </p>
      <p>
        The lines that connect them all together indicate that each page should
        be accessible from any other page, it is essentially showing us the
        global navigation for the site.
      </p>
      <!--
Choose your pages that you will create and put the names inside the two child page boxes… Some suggestions are below:

•	FAQ
•	Blog
•	Contact Us

      <h2>
        Wireframes
      </h2>
      <p>
        Wireframes are like blueprints for making webpages. They should show the
        major sections of content that will be on the page and the relative
        locations of each element. In the wireframe below you can see there will
        be 6 sections to our page:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          At the top we have a section with the logo and the navigation bar.
        </li>
        <li>
          Then there is a banner image that stretches all the way across the
          screen.
        </li>
        <li>Next we have some text and an image</li>
        <li>...followed by another row made up of an image and some text.</li>
        <li>Then one more section of text with no image.</li>
        <li>
          Lastly, a footer containing a copyright/name line and 3 social media
          icons.
        </li>
      </ol>
