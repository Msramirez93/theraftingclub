                                Absolutely this is a good trip for children of all ages. We have found however that
                                children over the age of 8 seem to enjoy it more overall (And parents especially enjoy it more if their children are all over 8).
                                A common concern we get from parents is that their children will be bored stuck on a
                                boat for hours at a time. Surprisingly we deal with very few bored children of any age.
                                The areas we are rafting through are some of the most beautiful in the world, and you never know
                                what you might see around any corner. Not to mention the rapids which keep things very
                                interesting ,Each boat also comes equipped with a guide. It has been proven that river
                                guides are unable to go for very long at all without telling stories...some of which are even true!

                        As with all adventure sports, there is an inherent and assumed element of risk. To help
                        ensure your safety, our guides are all certified in Wilderness First aid and all start with at
                        least 3 years of rafting experience.
                        The most common injuries are sunburns and injuries that occur on land. Everyone on
                        commercial rafting trips wears coast guard approved life vest or personal flotation device
                        (PFD).
                        Many non swimmers go on rafting trips and have a great time. Your guide will give you an
                        in depth and engaging safety talk before your trip begins explaining what you should
                        prepare for and do in the event that you fall out of the raft.

                        Are you kidding me! What's not great about whitewater rafting!...Let's describe a common
                        day on the river. Arise in the soft light of the early morning after a night spent sleeping
                        under a beautiful starry sky. Have a hearty warm breakfast of fresh blueberry pancakes or
                        omelets to order, then pack your things and prepare for the day The day is filled with some
                        combination of swift water, rapids, calms, hikes, history,
                        geology,stories, and more good food. We try to hit camp around 4 or 5, after setting up your
                        cot you can relax with a good book or good company by the river, or explore around camp while
                        your guides prepare your dinner...something perhaps like steak and potatoes, or grilled
                        salmon...and dutch oven brownies...you won't forget the dutch oven brownies.
                        After dinner it's more relaxing, and you might even be able to talk your guide into
                        another story or two to send you off to bed under more stars than you thought were possible.
